# TinderForFood

TinderForFood is an app that helps users find what to eat tonight! It pulls data from Google Maps API and Google Place Search API to display restaurants nearby the user. The user can then see lists of open restaurants, and their and ratings. The user also has options to vote depending on if the user has a large group of people. This will help them determine what to eat. Restaurants and votes will update depending on location.

This was my first time using Google APIs in an app instead of making separate calls, so this gave me quite a bit of trouble. It was built using React, and I had to utilize various higher order components in order to utilise the API properly. In addition, the map itself was hard to structure and pull data from.

## Things to come:
Searchable locations

Better UI

Better React State Structure
